# How to contribute

This is for Students at HelloWare AcademyWe to follow for their project collabrations. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Always create a feature branch based on master. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken. 

## Making Trivial Changes

### Documentation
- Write comments on top of the code block you want to comment on. 
- Use `//` only. Don't use `/* */`; 
## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the HelloWare organization.
